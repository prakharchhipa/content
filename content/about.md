Hello! My name is **Prakhar Chhipa**. I am a Senior Software Engineer, currently working n living in Gurgaon, India.

My passion for creating new things is something that has brought me here. Sticking to that I use this creativity to conquer technical challenges at [Airtel X Labs, India](https://www.linkedin.com/company/airtel-x-labs/). I design and develop software for a telecom giant covering millions of customers in various line of businesses.

When I am not busy digging the codes, I find myself cheering on the greatest of all time, Lionel Messi. Yes, it's all around football, foosball-table and FIFA(Xbox). With that I have a little wanderlust soul which loves exploring places with eyes of my canon 1300D and capture the best of the streets. Collection of electronic gadgets queued along.


If you'd like to work with me, would like to get more information, or if you'd just like to chat then email me to get in touch. [Email](mailto:prakharchhipa@gmail.com).
